Test suite for RL assignment

This is a framework for running tests for the RL Linux-based assignment. Users
should only be concerned with the check script; developers are to develop tests
in the tests/ folder.

Folder structure:
* check: main script, wrapper over actual tests
* config: checker configuration file; provides common functions for actual
          tests
* tests/: folders with tests
* test/test_XY: checker script file for task XY (X and Y are digits)


= Running the checker

When running the main script, it goes through all test scripts in the tests/
folder and runs them.
    ./check

If one desires to only run a certain test script, pass its number to the main
script. For, example, if one wants to run the test for task 8, one would issue
the command:
    ./check 8
